<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>
  This guided study takes us back to the past, from the origins of Computer Graphics, through the present day and into the future.
  We will see the development of the field through the advancement of the state-of-the-art over time.
  We will meet the great scientists who contributed to this history, understanding their motivations and the impact of their legacy on our culture and society. We will study the mathematical principles that underlie these results to understand how they lead to the formulation of numerical methods and algorithms essential for the creation of applications with new media.
<p>
  Our study process will be open and participatory, where the instructor and students will explore this universe together in an investigative manner, supported by modern learning resources.The course theme "3D Computer Vision with Neural Networks" integrates image analysis and synthesis for modeling three-dimensional scenes with machine learning.
